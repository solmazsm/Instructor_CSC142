#  Java Programming Assignment: Conditional Logic Practice

## Part 1: Test Score Average and Letter Grade

###  Objective:
Write a Java program that calculates the average of three test scores and displays the corresponding letter grade.

###  Requirements:
- Declare three variables to hold test scores as integers.
- Prompt the user to enter three test scores.
- Calculate the average of the three scores.
- Determine the letter grade using this grading scale:

| Test Score Average | Letter Grade |
|--------------------|--------------|
| 90â€“100             | A            |
| 80â€“89              | B            |
| 70â€“79              | C            |
| 60â€“69              | D            |
| Below 60           | F            |

###  Display:
- The three test scores
- The calculated average
- The letter grade

### ðŸ–¥Sample Output:
```
Enter score 1: 85
Enter score 2: 90
Enter score 3: 80
Average: 85.0
Grade: B
```

## Part 2: Bank Charges Calculator

### Objective:
Write a Java program that calculates monthly bank fees based on the number of checks written.

###  Requirements:
- Base monthly fee is $10.
- Check fees are:
  - $0.10 per check if fewer than 20 checks
  - $0.08 per check if 20â€“39 checks
  - $0.06 per check if 40â€“59 checks
  - $0.04 per check if 60 or more checks
- Prompt the user to enter the number of checks written.
- Calculate the total service fee: base fee + per-check fee.

###  Display:
- Number of checks written
- Fee per check
- Total service fee

### ðŸ–¥ Sample Output:
```
Enter number of checks: 35
Base fee: $10.00
Fee per check: $0.08
Total service charge: $12.80
```
